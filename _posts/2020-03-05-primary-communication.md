# Define a primary communication app and channels

It's not about what is the best communication application, its much more about avoid have not defined communication places, also try to use some place where people can get the communication history and are easy to communicate with a "broadcast way", like squads, teams, tribes

#### Example:
**squad:** talk into slack into channel #our-squad

**tribe:** use e-mail for tribe-xpo@yourcompany.com

**project-a:** use slack channel #project-a and Jira board for tasks history
